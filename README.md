# SystemLib --> V0.0.1 🚀

- This is a basic system lib for Nue. 🧠

**Libs:** 📚
- Finance: system.calc.finance 💰
- Physics: system.calc.physics 🔬
- Color: system.console.color 🎨
- LinuxOS: system.os.linux 🐧
- Windows: system.os.windows 🪟
- Vectors: system.std.mdim.vectors 🔢
- IO_Pkg: system.std.io_pkg 💾

**Features:** ✨
- There are multidimensional vectors in `vectors.pkg`, namely `vector2`, `vector3`, `vector4`, `vector8`, `vector16`, `vector32`, `vector64`, and you can even create any number you want! There's also a `vector128`, but it surpassed the maximum args count per void, so we'll continue that later. 🔢
- Almost all financial equations are present in `finance.pkg`, such as `Net Profit Margin (NPM)` and `Efficiency Ratio`. 💹
- You can control your system OS with multiple helpful commands present in `windows.pkg` and `linux.pkg`. 🖥️
- The `color.pkg` can provide you with terminal console colors to play with. 🌈
- And don't forget, the `physics.pkg` has a lot of pre-built physics functions, like `GearRatio` and `CentripetalAcceleration`. 🔍

**Known Bugs:** 🐞
- The `finance.pkg` has a lot of recurring functions, so make sure there are no repeating function names, or it might bother you a lot. 🤔
